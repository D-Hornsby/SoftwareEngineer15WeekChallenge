	<h3> Stories</h3>
  <p>The dogs keep me busy but sometimes I get to travel. I take my camera and tag along with my dad when he gets a trip planned. He usually has new sights to see along with revisits to old favorites so its always an adventure. Last time my Aunt joined us for the ride. She had never been out West so it was all a new adventure to her.</p>

	<p>One of the places we visited was Canyonlands National Park. This was my Aunts first time here but some hikes she could not make. So that she could still see what the hike was like I would hike the trail and take video to bring back so she could watch it while we were in location. One of the videos I took was this one of the Double Windows in Canyonlands. I shot this for my aunt and other family that could not join us.</p>
